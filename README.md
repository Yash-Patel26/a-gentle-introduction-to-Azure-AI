# A gentle introduction to AI on Azure

## Goals

In this workshop, we will discuss the reason behind the extraordinary media hype around AI we are currently living and we'll help learners digest the huge amount of news and updates in this technological domain.   


## Prerequisites

To replicate the demo included in the workshop on your own Azure subscription you'll need to:
1.	Create an Azure Subscription. If you are a student claim your [Azure for Students benefit]
2.  [Review the limited access policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/limited-access?context=%2Fazure%2Fcognitive-services%2Fopenai%2Fcontext%2Fcontext&WT.mc_id=academic-97358-cacaste) to Azure OpenAI service.
3.	[Apply for access to the Azure OpenAI Service](https://aka.ms/oai/access). Note that if your application doesn't match the [acceptance criteria](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/limited-access?context=%2Fazure%2Fcognitive-services%2Fopenai%2Fcontext%2Fcontext&WT.mc_id=academic-97358-cacaste), you can rely on the [OpenAI public APIs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction) to build your prototype.

## Milestone 1: What's behind the AI media hype

In this segment, we'll start by introducing what are the main innovations that are revolutionizing the AI landscape and their impact on societies.


## Milestone 2: How a Large Language Model works

Next, we'll be introducing the theory behind natural language processing and we'll explain how the transformer architecture enabled a faster progression towards generative AI.

## Milestone 3: OpenAI + Microsoft = Azure OpenAI service ❤️

Let's deep dive into what is Azure OpenAI service, what's the difference between Azure OpenAI Service and OpenAI and how this service is placed in the Azure AI platform.

Work through the [Introduction to Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/explore-azure-openai/?WT.mc_id=academic-97358-cacaste) training module to learn more.

## Milestone 4: Integrating generative AI into your application

Moving from theory to practice, let's see an example of an application which combines the capabilities of different Azure services into a single architecture, enabling the users with a ChatGPT like experience based on private data.

Look into the details of the solution, by reading this blog post: [Revolutionize your Enterprise Data with ChatGPT: Next-gen Apps w/ Azure OpenAI and Cognitive Search](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai-applied-ai-blog/revolutionize-your-enterprise-data-with-chatgpt-next-gen-apps-w/ba-p/3762087)

## Milestone 5: Using AI responsibly

Last - but not least - let's learn about the limits of generative AI models and let's discover the tools at our disposal to ensure we are creating less harmful and more trustworthy solutions. 

Explore [key Responsible AI guidelines and principles](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/transparency-note?context=%2Fazure%2Fcognitive-services%2Fopenai%2Fcontext%2Fcontext&WT.mc_id=academic-95355-cacaste&tabs=text&WT.mc_id=academic-97358-cacaste)
